# React App Template

This is a Rails API only template with a PostgreSQL database.
\
\
It is meant to be used with a React front-end. A template for that can be found [here]().

<br />

# Getting Started

To get started, in the project directory run the following commands:

### Install Gems

```
bundle install
```

### Update database.yml

Update the database line in `database.yml` to chanfe the name of your databases. Can be done for development, test, and production. Example:

```yml
development:
  <<: *default
  database: template_api_development
```

### Create Database
```
rails db:create
```

### Add Credentials
This project uses credentials to access environment variables. To update credentials use the following command (`code` can be replaced with desired editor):
```
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```
 
**Note**: if this errors at first, delete the `credentials.yml.enc` file in the `config/` folder, and try again. `The credentials.yml.enc` will be created by this command.

Credentials needed are listed below:
```yml
secret_key_base: # Automatically generated by Rails
site_url: 'http://localhost:3000' # Front-end URL
site_api_url: 'http://localhost:3001' # Back-end URL
devise_jwt_secret_key: # Used for devise. Can be generated with the command: bin/rails secret
sendgrid_api_key: # Used for devise password reset emails
mailer_email: # Your email to send from
```
In order to get `sendgrid_api_key` sign up for Sendgrid  [here](https://sendgrid.com/en-us). Config can be updated in `development.rb` under `smtp_settings`

### Migrate Database
```
rails db:migrate
```

### Start Server

```
bin/rails server
```

Runs the Rails API in the development mode on port 3001.
